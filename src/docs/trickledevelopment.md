Work that Trickle has done thus far:

This is the initial setup for the email autoresponder system with a basic dashboard layout. I'll continue by implementing the email processing and knowledge base components. Would you like me to proceed with those next?

Create index.html
Create styles/main.css
Create styles/dashboard.css

Create components/Sidebar.js
Create app.js



I've implemented all the requested modules with the following features:

Email Autoresponder System
Create utils/aiAgent.js
Create utils/emailProcessor.js
Create components/Analytics.js
Create components/KnowledgeBase.js
Create components/EmailList.js

    AI Agent (utils/aiAgent.js):

    Generates responses using the knowledge base
    Analyzes email sentiment
    Determines if escalation is needed

    Email Processor (utils/emailProcessor.js):
